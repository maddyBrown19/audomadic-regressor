# Audomadic Regression for Bike Shares
To run this machine learning regression project, type "python3 audomadic.ipynb" into terminal. Keep in mind that the file is a Jupyter notebook, so you can run individual cells one at a time to follow along with the project journey, or you can run all cells at once to see the final results of our models and their performance. The files named "attempt.ipynb" and "workspace.ipynb" served as our personal scratch workspaces for this project, so please do not reference those files for final or updated code.
